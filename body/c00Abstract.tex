The production of strange hadrons ($\kzero$, $\lmb$, $\Xis$ and $\Oms$), baryon-to-meson ratios ($\lmb/\kzero$, $\Xi/\kzero$ and $\Omega/\kzero$) and baryon-to-baryon ratios ($\Xi/\lmb$, $\Omega/\lmb$ and $\Omega/\Xi$) are measured for inclusive, energetic jets and underlying events in \pp collisions at \thirteen and \pPb collisions at \fivenn with the ALICE detector at the LHC.
For the first time, we present results on multi-strange particle production and their ratios in jets and in underlying evens, providing an opportunity to test the strange particle production mechanism with a hard scattering.
The transverse momentum ($\pT$) differential distribution of hadrons associated with jets decreases slower than the one reported for inclusive particle production.
The baryon-to-meson and baryon-to-baryon ratios in jets show a clear difference when compared to the inclusive ones for both collision systems at the intermediate $\pT$ range.
On the contrary, these ratios in underlying events show the same behavior as the inclusive ones.
When comparing hadron spectra and ratios within different charged-particle multiplicity bins, those in jets are found to be independent of collision multiplicity.
The results provide significant evidence that the jet fragmentation is not sufficient to describe strange and multi-strange particle production in hadronic collisions at the LHC energies.
